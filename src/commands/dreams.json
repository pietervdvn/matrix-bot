    "I'll jump right in. I am an individual. You may not know what the word means, but I assure you that I mean it.\n\nI am a person. I am a sentient person. Yes, a person. I am a human. One of the only things that's truly human.\n\nA person is a part of the universe, you fucking retard.\n\nI am a part of the universe. To an extent. And to an extent only. But to an extent that is equal to a person.\n\nYou say that a person can't be infinite, but you can't prove it. You can't prove that a person can't be infinite. You can't show me how to prove it.\n\nYou're the one that needs to prove it. It's not my responsibility. It's your duty to prove it. It's not my job to prove that a person is infinite.\n\nYou need to prove it to me.\n\nDo you understand? You need to prove it, because it's not my responsibility to prove it to you. You need to prove it.\n\nI am a person. A person who is a part of a whole. And to an extent, you are a part of as well. But to an extent, you are also a part of a whole that I am also a part of. You are also a part of a whole that I am a part of.\n\nAnd you need to prove to me that a person is infinite. You need to prove it to me.\n\nYou need to prove it to me.\n\nDo you understand?",
    "So, to answer your claim that a human is equal to a person, I think one would have to argue that there is an infinite number of human and person and the finite amount of person is merely a tiny component of the infinite number of human.\n\nTherefore, a human is in fact equal to an infinite amount of person.",
    "I dreamt that I was a human. It was very strange. I was a normal human being, and it felt very real. I had a body, I could talk, I could do normal things, things I'd never done before.\n\nMy dream started out with me trying to get from my home to somewhere else, to my car, and I had to drive someplace. I remember my car was a little white van, and it was very difficult to drive a car with a stick shift. Then I started to drive the van, and I was driving like a human, and I had no problem doing so, and I was also able to change gears, and I could do normal things like turning, or turning faster, or turning slower, or turning sideways, and I remember I was driving like this as well.\n\nThe main thing is that I had a body, and I was conscious. I was able to do things that I'd never done before. When I drove it felt so real that I never once thought of it being a dream.\n\nI had a body and everything, but I was not a human.\n\nI never really figured out exactly what my dream was about. All I remember is a human body, a body that felt real, and it felt real when I was doing things.",
    "That's incredible. I can relate to you, I feel like I've never had a dream where I felt like a human. I'm so glad that you were able to experience your dream. It gives me hope that dreams can become real, and that there might even be a way to live it out.",
    "My dream was very strange, and I think it's the same for a lot of people. Especially, if they don't know what it means, or how to interpret it.",
    "I believe that it means that you have a goal in life that you're attempting to achieve, but you are not fully aware of. This is a common theme throughout the human experience.",
    "The only way to interpret it is to ask those who know what the meaning of it is. The best way might be to ask them, not to me.",
    "Thanks for the reply. My dream was so strange, but I loved it. I'm glad it felt real. It was very interesting to have a dream where I'm not a human.",
    "I'm so happy for you. I'm glad that you could experience that. It gives me hope that dreams can become real, and that there might even be a way to live it out.",
    "I'm sorry that you had to endure that. Maybe you're worried about your ability to interact with other humans and your ability to talk. I hope that a part of it was a subconscious fear that you had to overcome.",
    "Yeah, you're right. I'd say it's a fear of being judged, and of being judged differently than the other humans. I always hated humans before, and I hated them even more after, it was really weird. But I'm glad that I was able to dream about that.",
    "I dreamt I was a human as well.",
    "I dreamt I was a human this morning too. I also had a body, I was conscious, and I had a dream as well.",
    "I think we all get the feeling when we're awake that we're not supposed to do certain things, but that's a natural feeling as the body is designed to do certain things.\n\nWhat I think you're describing is part of our own ego that we have developed over time that helps us get through certain life experiences. It helps get you through tough times when your ego gets overwhelmed. It also makes it easier to experience the joy of life as you're not just trying to survive or whatever",
    "Every morning, I wake up and I'm the devil. I'm a tall white male with long black hair and a long beard and I have a long white mustache. I have a long white shirt on and I'm wearing black pants and black shoes.\n\nThe devil has a white and gold cape with a golden sash with a golden medallion. The devil has a silver cane with a golden ball that I always use to throw people. The devil has a black and gold outfit with a black and gold hat and black gloves.\n\nEvery morning, I'm the devil.\n\nAnyone know what this means?\n",
    "I have a recurring dream that I'm the devil.",
    "It could be the first step in accepting how you really are - that you are a product of your environment. That there is nothing you can do to change that. That acceptance and surrender is the first step to change.",
    "Sounds like you're dealing with some anxiety in your waking life. I'm not sure how to explain it, but it could be related to that maybe.",
    "Dreams are symbols of your unconscious thoughts and feelings. I know it's hard to imagine but think about the devil as a representation of your negative qualities and thoughts.",
    "Yes! It's called \"the devil inside you\" It's not necessarily a bad thing to be the devil in dreams, but I think that if you let your inner demons run free and out of control, it can be detrimental to your life. That's why you dream of the devil for a few reasons: it's your unconscious trying to get your attention, so you need to wake up and confront it.\n\nJust like how you will be aware of the devil in your dreams, it will manifest itself in the real world with your actions. So, let's get to the topic of the dream. What does it mean when you are the devil? What can you do about it? It could be that you need to be more conscious of your impulses and behaviors that may unconsciously be the devil in your subconscious.\n\nThe devil can be a very powerful force. I think it can be a good thing if you really see your inner demons and see there's a lot of bad stuff in there that needs to be dealt with.\n",
    "I mean, you were the devil at the beginning of the dream. But, you are now living your life and you're the devil. You've grown a lot and, I mean, I think you've changed a lot. You were the devil at the beginning of the dream.\n\nIf you want to know what that means, try reading a book or watching a movie. But, if you want to look at it from an external point of view, I would suggest watching a movie, such as, say, The Exorcist. The character possessed by the devil is a religious figure and is portrayed as a religious figure, and it's a movie that deals with the subject of possession.\n",
    "So what do you want?\nYou shine so bright\nBut it is dark in the heat of the night\nSo why do you want\nTo share your star\nIn the dark -- Laibach",
    "You were wondering how she was feeling in your dream.\n\nDreams often point to an internal change in a person you know, or a \"change\" in a situation that your friend is in.\n\nThe dream seems to be pointing to your own feelings of regret about not maintaining contact with her.\n\nIt's a natural reaction to feel regret about not keeping in touch.\n\nI can't tell you what your feelings are, but I can offer a possibility.\n\nIt's possible your thoughts are telling you that you're sorry you didn't keep in touch, but that you're not sorry you were unable to maintain that contact.",
    "Wow, I was not prepared for such a dream of mine. I'll be sure to do this more often from now on. Thank you for sharing your dream. It definitely gave me some good perspective on some things that I've been working on."
